## Tasks

In this pair coding interview the goal for us is to asses your basic knowledge of the following technologies:

- Vue
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Git

To do this we are going to ask you to build a simple TODO list app. It should be something very similar to https://todomvc.com/examples/vue/. The user stories for this app are the following:

As a user:

- I should be able to see a list of my todos
- I should be able to *add* TODOs to the list
- I should be able to *remove* TODOs from the list
- I should be able to *mark* TODOs as completed
- I should be able to *filter* TODOs by *ALL*, *ACTIVE* and *COMPLETED*

Extra bonus:

- Add a button to mark all TODOs in the list as *completed* or mark all as *active* if they where already mark as completed.
- Add a number indicator telling how many *active* TODOs remain on the list
-
