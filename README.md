# frontend-vue-coding-interview

In this pair coding interview the goal for us is to asses your basic knowledge of the following technologies:

- Vue
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Git

To do this we are going to ask you to build a simple TODO list app. It should be something very similar to https://todomvc.com/examples/vue/.


## Instructions

Fork this repo and clone it to your machine. After that install the dependencies with `yarn install`. Once that's ready the repo is basically an empty Vue CLI project with the default settings. After that you can start implementing the user stories.


## User stories

As a user:

- I should be able to see a list of my todos
- I should be able to **add** TODOs to the list
- I should be able to **remove** TODOs from the list
- I should be able to **mark** TODOs as completed
- I should be able to **filter** TODOs by **ALL**, **ACTIVE** and **COMPLETED**

Extra bonus:

- Add a button to mark all TODOs in the list as **completed** or mark all as **active** if they where already mark as completed.
- Add a number indicator telling how many **active** TODOs remain on the list

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```
